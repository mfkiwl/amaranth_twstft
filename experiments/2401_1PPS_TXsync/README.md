Top: Two-Way transfer resulting from the fine analysis of the correlation
peak of the difference of (transmitted-loopback) signals. Middle: standard
deviation on each transmitted signal record after removing the parabolic trend.
Bottom: velocity of the satellite as slope of the transmitted signal received
on the other side of the link.

Ranging results from Besancon as coarse time delay between the transmitted signal 
and the loopback.

For comparison, the ranging measurement from Paris (OP) during 2023
as recorded at https://webtai.bipm.org/ftp/pub/tai/data/2023/time_transfer/twstft/op/
with a result consistent with the chard displayed above.
