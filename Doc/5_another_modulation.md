# Generating our carrier signal
Back to the [README](../README.md)
Previous step : [mixing signals](4_Mixing_Signals.md)

Alright ! We now have a very fine FPGA device producing a 70MHz signal BPSK modulated. What about doubling the amount of data transmitted with the exactly same modulation frequency of the carrier signal ?

Next step : [Conclusion of this project](6_Conclusion.md)
