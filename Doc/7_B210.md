### B210 integration

The project so far has focused on generating a PRN generator and the
carrier signal using one FPGA, and recording the radiofrequency signal
for post-processing with an Ettus Research B210 SDR transceiver. The B210
FPGA however still has plenty of space left, so that the PRN generation 
gateware can be merged with the datastream handling functions provided by
Ettus Research. Since the two functions are running independently, the
Amaranth generate Verilog code is merged next to the original B210 software
and the resulting program is synthesized to produce a single bitstream.

Putting the resulting ``usrp_b210_fpga.bin`` in ``/usr/share/uhd/images/``
will tell UHD to configure the B210 FPGA with the updated bitstream which
is generated according to the following procedure.

#### B210 bitstream generation

A patch is provided to modify B210 firmware:

```
git clone https://github.com/EttusResearch/uhd.git
cd uhd
git checkout v4.1.0.5 -b v4.1.0.5
patch -p1 < /somewhere/amaranth_twstft/0001-b200-add-pps_gen-stream-tag-and-twstft-amaranth_uhd-v4.1.0.5.patch
cd fpga/usrp3/top/b200
make B210 [TAPS=XXX] [NOISELEN=YYY] [BITLEN=ZZZ] [INVERT_FIRST_CODE=1]
```

**Note:** `TAPS` `NOISELEN` and BITLEN are used to select a specific taps and to
configure PRN length before reinit. `INVERT_FIRST_CODE` is used to apply a xor
for the first code after PPS rise.

#### Pin functions

The input and output signals are available on the GPIO header J504 next
to the FPGA:

- PPS in to be connected to the corresponding SMA
- fp_gpio 1: enable
- fp_gpio 3: output signal
- fp_gpio 5: pps out
- fp_gpio 7: switch BPSK/QPSK
