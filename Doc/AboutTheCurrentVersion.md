# About the current version of the project

The version of the python implementation available in this repository is a little more advanced than what's described in the tutorial. It contains some additionnal features such as :
+ The possibility to change the transmission mode from BPSK to QPSK while the ZedBoard is already working through the use of a switch button
+ PrnGenerator module can recreate a LFSR of any size following the bit length we are giving to it
+ Currently, the way we configured the board doesn't allow it but if configured properly, we could flash the bitstream so that the taps of the LFSR are chosen through the use of GPIO or something else while the program is running. Most of the modules are ready to handle the situation.
+ The prn.py file also contains a few utility functions that help working with different taps (finding a list of taps, \[writing them into/reading them from\] a file, saving in binary files the prn generated by a certain LFSR...)
+ The file that flashes the ZedBoard permits to set all the parameters we wish to change with our B/QPSK transmitter.

```
./flashZedBoard.py -h

usage: flashZedBoard.py [-h] [-s SEED] [-t TAPS] [-m MODFREQ] [-p] [-v] bitlen noiselen

positional arguments:
  bitlen                number of bits of the LFSR
  noiselen              length of the PRN sequence

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s SEED, --seed SEED  initial value of the LFSR (default : 1)
  -t TAPS, --taps TAPS  taps positions for the LFSR (if not defined, allows to dynamically define taps 
                        (currently not supported so the program will ask you which taps to use))
  -m MODFREQ, --modfreq MODFREQ
                        frequency of the PSK modulation (Herz) (default :2.5e6)
  -p, --print           creates a binary file containing the PRN sequence that should be generated (also prevents flashing the bitstream)
  -v, --verbose         prints all the parameters used for this instance of the program
```
