# UHD 4.1.0.5

Current *USRP* patches are based on *uhd* v4.1.0.5. If your distribution provides a different
version of UHD (see the extension of ``libuhd.so.*`` in one of the ``/usr/lib`` subdirectories),
then use [PyBOMBS](https://github.com/gnuradio/pybombs) to install all required tools with the 
requested version as explained below.

## Prerequisites

You needs to install:
- `python3-pip`
- `git`
- `g++`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gnuradio/pybombs.git
cd pybombs
pip3 install --user -e .
```

*PyBOMBS* is installed in `$HOME/.local`, so the `PATH` variable is updated to include this location:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin
```

## Prepare tools

```bash
pybombs auto-config
pybombs recipes add-defaults
```
The default *UHD* version is UHD-4.2. The *uhd.lwr* recipe must be modified to
select the targeted versio 4.1.0.5 instead. This is achieved by editing the file 
located in *$HOME/.pybombs/recipes/gr-recipes* and replacing

```
gitbranch: UHD-4.2
```

with

```
gitbranch: v4.1.0.5
```

## Build GNU Radio, VOLK, UHD

```
pybombs prefix init ~/prefix-UHD -R gnuradio-default
```

Everything (source, build and final tools) will be located in
*$HOME/prefix-UHD*.

To have access to the newly installed versions of GNU Radio and UHD, environment variables must
be loaded with

```bash
source ~/prefix-UHD/setup_env.sh
```
and then execute ``gnuradio-companion``.

### Incompatibility between *pybind11* and *python-3.11*

With the recent *python* release (3.11), *UHD* fails due to an
incompatiblity between *PyBind11* shipped with *UHD* and *python*. This was
fixed by [this
commit](https://github.com/EttusResearch/uhd/commit/ed1da9aa785dffafbe24763fbee5ba17f513d509)

Solution: after a first failure to compile, *UHD* sources are located in
*$HOME/prefix-UHD/src/uhd*. A patch is provided (assuming ``amaranth_twstft`` has been
downloaded in ``$HOME``, adjust accordingly):

```
cd $HOME/prefix-UHD/src/uhd
patch -p1 < $HOME/amaranth_twstft/0003-v4.1.0.5-python-update-to-pybind11-for-Python-3.11.patch
```

Then again:

```
pybombs prefix init ~/prefix-UHD -R gnuradio-default
```
which should hopefully complete with a successful build. Then load the environment variables with
```bash
source ~/prefix-UHD/setup_env.sh
```
and execute ``gnuradio-companion``.
